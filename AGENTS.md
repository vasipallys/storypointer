# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Story Pointer: an evidence-led story-point estimator (modified Fibonacci 1/2/3/5/8/13) for React/Spring teams. FastAPI backend runs a checkpointed LangGraph pipeline and streams progress over SSE; React 19 + Vite frontend (Material 3 shell) consumes the stream. Stories come from a form, Jira, a spreadsheet upload, or — via the project workspace — from L3 components of an interactive C4 model whose points roll up to epics and initiatives. Each L1 initiative can also carry an operating plan (teams, cost, schedule, architecture diagrams).

This is a monorepo. The root `package.json` orchestrates project commands; `frontend/package.json` owns the React/Vite workspace, `desktop/package.json` owns Electron packaging, and Python backend dependencies stay in `requirements.txt`. See `docs/monorepo.md` for the boundary map and runner commands.

`LLM_PROVIDER=mock` in `backend/.env` runs the full pipeline offline with no API key (deterministic, hash-based points) — use it for local UI work and demos.

`AGENTS.md` is a near-verbatim mirror of this file for Codex; keep the two in sync when editing architecture notes.

## Architecture

### Estimation pipeline (the core)

- `backend/graph/build.py` — wires the LangGraph `StateGraph`: score_parameters → identify_drivers → compare_to_anchors → derive_points → (conditional `spike_split_branch` when points == 13 or uncertainty is High) → write_plain_language_reasoning → detect_hidden_tasks → assess_risks → recommend_split. Compiled with `MemorySaver`; the caller's `session_id` becomes the `thread_id`, which is what makes refinements ("re-estimate assuming X") work against a prior run.
- `backend/graph/state.py` — the `EstimationState` TypedDict plus one Pydantic output schema per node (`ScorecardOutput`, `PointsOutput`, etc.). These schemas are the contract between prompts and state.
- `backend/graph/nodes.py` — all node prompts and implementations. Contains `_parse_structured_result`, which tolerates provider quirks (raw/parsed envelopes, markdown-fenced JSON, Groq list echoes) — structured-output bugs are usually fixed there, not in the nodes.

### Project workspace and C4 model

- Persistence is stdlib SQLite ([backend/storage/db.py](backend/storage/db.py)) at `data/storypointer.db` (override: `STORYPOINTER_DB` env var); LangGraph checkpoints go to `data/checkpoints.db` via `AsyncSqliteSaver`, installed in the API lifespan through [backend/graph/checkpoint.py](backend/graph/checkpoint.py) — tests and bare imports fall back to `MemorySaver`.
- `backend/projects/` (CRUD + repo/Jira links) and `backend/c4/` (elements, relations, artifact links, imports, roll-up) follow store/service/router layering. Level rules: an element's parent must be exactly one level up; L1→initiative, L2→epic, L3→story, L4→task (`ARTIFACT_FOR_LEVEL` in [backend/c4/models.py](backend/c4/models.py)); cross-cutting bug/tech_debt/arch_flow artifacts tag elements at allowed levels.
- Estimation of an element (L3/L4 only) builds a `Story` with `c4_context` (parent chain, relations, code path — see `element_to_story` in [backend/c4/service.py](backend/c4/service.py)) and reuses `stream_story` from [backend/api/streaming.py](backend/api/streaming.py) with an `on_result` callback that persists points and seeds proposed L4 tasks (from `hidden_tasks`) and sibling L3 stories (from split recommendations). Roll-ups are deterministic sums — never LLM output; `proposed` elements are excluded.
- SSE helpers live in `backend/api/streaming.py` (not `main.py`) so the C4 router can import them without a circular import.

### L1 operating plans (`backend/planning/`)

- Each **L1 element** can carry an operating plan: agile units (tribes → squads), team members, scheduled/costed work items, and mermaid architecture/infrastructure diagrams — all in the `l1_*` tables in [backend/storage/db.py](backend/storage/db.py). Same store/router layering as the other modules; the router mounts under `/projects/{id}/l1/...` in [backend/planning/router.py](backend/planning/router.py).
- Invariants enforced in [backend/planning/store.py](backend/planning/store.py): a plan attaches only to an L1 element; a squad's parent must be a tribe in the same plan; a work item's `linked_element_id` must be an L2–L4 descendant of that L1, and its `squad_id` a squad in the same plan; `end_date >= start_date`.
- `get_plan` returns the plan plus **deterministically computed** `metrics` (people, allocated FTE, monthly run-rate, planned/actual cost + variance, at-risk work) — no LLM involvement. Money is presentation-only; the stored `currency_code` (per-L1 `l1_plan_settings`) just labels it.

### Desktop app (`desktop/`, Electron + PyInstaller)

- The same web build and FastAPI backend ship as a self-contained desktop app; no code forks. `desktop/electron/main.cjs` is the Electron main process: it starts the backend, waits on `/health`, then loads the UI (dev server URL when `ELECTRON_DEV_SERVER_URL` is set, otherwise `dist/index.html`).
- **Backend launch is dual-mode** ([main.cjs](desktop/electron/main.cjs) `backendCommand`): packaged builds run the bundled PyInstaller exe from `process.resourcesPath/backend`; unpackaged (`desktop:dev`) runs `python -m desktop.backend_launcher` from the repo. `backend_launcher.py` just calls `uvicorn.run(..., reload=False)` on host/port from `STORYPOINTER_API_*`.
- **Port handling**: prefers `8765`, reuses an already-healthy instance on it, else picks a random free port — so a dev backend and the desktop app coexist. A single-instance lock prevents duplicate windows.
- **The UI never bakes in the API URL.** Electron injects the resolved base via `additionalArguments`; `preload.cjs` exposes it as `window.storyPointer.apiBaseUrl`, and [client.js](frontend/src/api/client.js) prefers that over `VITE_API_BASE_URL`. Desktop data is per-user: `STORYPOINTER_DB` and the backend env file live under Electron's `userData` dir, seeded from `desktop/backend.env.example` on first run.
- **Bundling** ([scripts/build-backend-bundle.mjs](scripts/build-backend-bundle.mjs)) runs PyInstaller against `desktop/pyinstaller/storypointer-api.spec` → `desktop/backend-dist/`; the spec lists provider/langgraph/docx/pptx packages as `hiddenimports` (PyInstaller can't see dynamic imports, so **a new LLM provider or optional dep must be added there** or it's missing at runtime). `desktop:prepare` chains icon gen + web build + backend bundle before `electron-builder` (config in `package.json` `build`).

### Strict module boundaries

- `backend/llm/factory.py` is the **only** module allowed to know provider names. Native LangChain providers go in `NATIVE_PROVIDERS` (via `init_chat_model`); OpenAI-compatible endpoints (Moonshot, DeepSeek, Ollama, …) share `ChatOpenAI(base_url=...)` via `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE`. Groq gets `json_mode` structured output. `LLM_PROVIDER=mock` (`OFFLINE_PROVIDERS`) needs no API key and routes structured calls to the deterministic [backend/llm/mock.py](backend/llm/mock.py) — points come from a hash of the story title, so tests and demos are stable and offline. The API-key requirement is provider-specific and lives in `validate_factory_config`, not `config.py`. Adding a provider means editing the factory only.
- `backend/jira/registry.py` mirrors that boundary for Jira: `JIRA_INSTANCES=prod,sandbox` env names expand to `JIRA_<NAME>_*` variables parsed in `backend/config.py`. Cloud instances use REST v3 + Basic auth (email + token); Server/DC uses REST v2 + Bearer PAT (`backend/jira/client.py`). Instance names/auth are validated at startup, credentials lazily on first use.
- `backend/anchors.py` holds six fixed calibration stories injected into every comparison prompt — no embeddings or retrieval. Calibration changes are edits to this file plus an API restart.

### API behavior (`backend/api/main.py`)

- All estimation routes stream SSE. `node` events are progress-only; the final `result` event is emitted atomically and the server raises if `plain_language_why` or `tldr` is missing — a point value must never appear without its explanation.
- Startup config errors don't crash the app: `lifespan` stashes them in `app.state.configuration_errors`, `/health` reports them, and estimation routes return 503 via `require_llm_config`.
- All errors (HTTP and in-stream) use the shape `{ "error": { code, message, details, retryable } }`.
- Jira write-back is triple-gated: `JIRA_WRITE_ENABLED=true` env, `confirm=true` on the request, and per-issue confirmation in the UI.

### Configuration

All backend config comes from `backend/.env` (loaded by `backend/config.py`, typed via pydantic-settings). Frontend reads only `VITE_API_BASE_URL` from `frontend/.env`. Provider/model strings must not appear in application code outside the LLM factory.

### Frontend

- `frontend/src/App.jsx` is a small state-based router (no router lib): `home` → `wizard` → `project`, plus a standalone `quick`. [ProjectWorkspace](frontend/src/screens/ProjectWorkspace.jsx) hosts the nav-rail tabs — **canvas / L1 plan / rollup / quick / overview**. Top-level screens live in `frontend/src/screens/`.
- The C4 canvas (`frontend/src/c4/`) is React Flow (`@xyflow/react`): [C4Canvas.jsx](frontend/src/c4/C4Canvas.jsx) with an [InspectorPanel](frontend/src/c4/InspectorPanel.jsx) side panel. Estimation runs in a **modal** ([EstimateDialog.jsx](frontend/src/c4/EstimateDialog.jsx)), not inline — it streams the pipeline then shows the full `ResultCard`; results are cached per element so "View reasoning" reopens without re-running.
- L1 planning UI is in `frontend/src/planning/` (teams, work/cost, mermaid diagram studio), opened from the L1 plan tab or the inspector's "More details" on an L1 node.
- The original single-story flow (form / Jira browser / Excel upload) is now the **Quick estimate** screen ([QuickEstimate.jsx](frontend/src/screens/QuickEstimate.jsx)); its building blocks stay in `frontend/src/components/`.
- `frontend/src/api/client.js` wraps every endpoint plus `consumeSSE` for streaming. Material 3 styling lives in [frontend/src/md3.css](frontend/src/md3.css) (the workspace shell) alongside the older `styles.css` (estimation components). Tests colocate as `*.test.jsx` (jsdom + Testing Library, setup in `frontend/src/test-setup.js`).
